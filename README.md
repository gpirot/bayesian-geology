# bayesian-geology
An umbrella project for Bayesian geological inference

This will end up being a target repository for a number of related projects having to do with Bayesian inference on geological posteriors.

## blockworlds

A sandbox module for investigating model error in geological posterior distributions based on the discretization of the 3-D geology for the geophysical forward calculation.  Current dependencies include the SimPEG geophysics library.
